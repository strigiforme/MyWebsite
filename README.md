# MyWebsite -- Live at howardpearce.ca
A website that I can send to future employers or colleagues to demonstrate my skills and easily increase my influence / reach. I'm trying to incorporate the following aspects:

### Modern Design
I'm using a self-made simple layout with a dark theme, and modern design aspects. I tend to use dark themes, with sans-serif fonts and a blue accent color.
The website is intended to demonstrate I have knowledge of modern web-design technologies and can create good webpages.

### Version
This is my fourth reiteration of my website, I haven't been satisfied with the design yet, and plan to keep rehashing until I get something that I like.

### Features
Fluid website design that has following features:
  - Responsive
  - Animated SVG elements
  - Miscellaneous JS features
  - Database functionality (in-work)
  
### Suggestions?
If you feel you could improve I insist you send some code my way, I love feedback especially for this type of project where design is NOT my strong suit (hence the four versions).
